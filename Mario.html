											<h2>Game Concept</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My version of this game wasn't anythig special. I had Mario and Luigi both spawn on screen with 2 Koopas they had as enemies</p>
										<p>Aim of the game was to take out both the opposing koopa without being hit after otherwise the game would end.</p>
										<p>The brothers had the ability to jump and move either side without any issues. The could also use the power of the POW block which knocked over the Koopas</p>
                    <p>This is where the brothers would take advantage and kill the Koopas on screen. If not done in time the koopas proceed to jump back over. </p>

                        <h2>Future Impovements</h2>
                      </header>
                    <p>I didnt manage to implement a respawn for the koopas so after the first two that is about it. Nor do they stop at the border of the map so if not killed they walk of the map in which then they die.</p>
                    <p>So to start this is somethign i would change. I would implemented a respawn and further improve this by adding a score counter as the now respawning enemies would increase player scores on death</p>
                    <p>With a scoreboard i can then move that into a leaderboard which would be a seperate screen that the user can visit and look at previous scores</p>
                    <p>I would also like to further improve this with addition enemies such as Goomba, and also coins for the player to collect which could do something like increase lives after collecting so many</p?
                    <p>I think implementing these current ideas would make for some good progress which i could potentially do during the summer to further improve my abilities and understanding with coding</p>
